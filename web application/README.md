# CancerExplorer


## Spatial Cause-Effect Relationships Explorer


### Introduction
The project deals with cancer related cause-effect relationships. Moreover, which aim is to create a
web-based assistance system for the exploration of cause-effect relationships of selected cancer
types in a predefined geographic region.
The application is a result of an external semester contribution, which was mainly focused on the modelling part (domain ontology, information aggregation).


### Purpose
The application should present possible causes for high cancer incidence rates in a spatial context. It does so, by
using the chain linking of different variables that is encoded as linked data.

  
### Status
The version **(30.09.2014)** is in a very early development step.

This brings along:

- Limited information retrieval ( for development purposes only a test RDF repository can be queried) 
- Long list of issues (refresh your browser view after queries)
